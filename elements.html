									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images\kanishka.png" alt="" /></span> I'm an experienced finance and accounting professional well-versed in database and visualisation tools for data analysis such as SQL, Excel, Python, Tableau, and Power BI. I have over 1 year of experience in accounting and finance and 1 year of experience in tax consulting. I am currently enrolled at Durham College, where I am studying data analytics for business decision-making. Through my educational training at Durham College, I have developed a thorough understanding of how to analyse, organize, and manipulate data to support problem-solving, business decision-making, opportunity identification, trend forecasting, statistical analysis, data interpretation, and more. I have acquired and am honing my skills in some IT skills such as advanced Excel, MYSQL, Python, R, Tableau, and PowerBI for data visualization.</p>
									
									<p>I obtained a certification for a Canadian securities course that I successfully completed. This course gave me in-depth understanding of the Canadian securities industry and taught me about stocks, mutual funds, and derivatives. Technical research and analysis of financial assets is what I've been studying, and I've been learning how historical stock prices and stock market data can be analysed to spot past trends and predict them. In my previous company, I also came to the realisation that in order to alter processes and produce better results, I needed data analytic tool capabilities in addition to my domain knowledge in finance.</p>

									<p>I hope my portfolio is as interesting to you as it exciting to me, and with my past experience as a finance professional and my current knowledge and skills as an aspiring data analyst, I am aiming to help organisations achieve</p>
