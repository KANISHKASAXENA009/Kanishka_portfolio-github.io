										Data Analytics - Capstone Project</a></h2>
								<p>Credit card payment default prediction is a data analytics solution to predict potential payment defaults on credit cards by customers. We used a dataset of credit card usage to build a machine learning algorithm that can predict the probability of upcoming months' payment defaults.
										<br />
										The solution of this project and algorithm can be deployed into the system of any financial organization. Financial advisers or line of credit authorization officers at bank may access this system and use it to know the probability of clientâ€™s payment default for upcoming month. The solution can help institutions to reduce its NPA and payment defaults

									<p>The storyline was developed to demonstrate the global vaccination status in the fight against COVID-19 on various continents. Various continents' fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated, and daily vaccination status are depicted in the storyline visualizations. The visualisation answers which continent is vaccinating more people per year to fight COVID-19. KPIs are used to calculate the percentage of the population that is partially and fully vaccinated.</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/KANISHKASAXENA009/DataAnalysisToolsProject" class="image fit"><img src="images\meental health.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>For this project, I looked into a dataset from a 2014 study that measures attitudes about mental health and the prevalence of mental health conditions in the IT workplace.

										In this assignment, I examined how people's opinions toward mental illness vary geographically and according to the kinds of occupations they hold.
										
										To create high-level visualisations to analyse the attitude toward mental health in IT businesses, the dataset was processed and functions that take attributes as input were constructed.
										
										Jupyter notebook, Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Github were the technologies used.</p>

									<p>A $100,000 virtual investment portfolio was formed between September 28 and November 19. Securities were bought and traded virtually throughout this time period. The cost of the shares was continuously monitored during this time. Additionally, the performance of an index and a portfolio return was compared. In this assignment, a portfolio was created using MS Excel, and Excel visualisations were also used to compare the initial and final portfolios.
